<P><font color="black">
<h3>Delivering peace of mind
Since our founding in 1969, the content of the packages we deliver has changed quite a bit. But one thing remains the same—how we earn your trust. For nearly half a century, we’ve built a reputation as the most trusted specialty logistics company in the world through our unsurpassed knowledge, global reach and flawless supply chain execution.

Couriers are distinguished from ordinary mail services by features such as speed, security, tracking, signature, specialization and individualization of express services, and swift delivery times, which are optional for most everyday mail services. As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is normally limited to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost.some of the courier services included are:<br>

<ul>


<li>standard courier services</li>
<li>over night service</li>

<li>same day express courier</li>

<li>internation courier</li>
<li>pallet courier services</li>

</ul>

<h3><b>Types of service providers:</b>
Carriers are large delivery companies that have a wide delivery network and a large fleet. Their fleet includes airplanes, trucks, vans, and ships. Carriers offer an entire supply chain solution for a large variety of goods. FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Services (UPS) are examples of carriers.
Freight forwarders are subcontractors to airlines or carriers. Most freight forwarders offer specialized services like pallets, parcels, or bulky goods transport.
Haulage services transport bulky and heavy goods. Haulage services are not trackable like the services of carriers or freight forwarders. Most hauliers make use of rail networks like CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC), and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) to transport goods</h3>
